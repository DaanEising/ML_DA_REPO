    "# 1. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT):\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is an efficient algorithm for computing the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). It's like a speedy way to analyze the frequency content of a signal. Instead of taking a long time to calculate the DFT manually, the FFT quickly breaks down a sequence of data points into its frequency components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Imagine you have a digital signal representing the vibrations of a guitar string over time. Applying the FFT allows you to rapidly identify the specific musical frequencies present in the sound. If the guitar string produces a clear note at a particular frequency, the FFT would efficiently highlight that frequency, making it easier to recognize the musical pitch and analyze the harmonic structure of the guitar sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Mel Filterbanks:\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "Mel Filterbanks are filters used in audio processing and speech recognition to mimic the human ear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider an audio clip of someone playing a guitar. Using Mel Filterbanks, you can capture the essential features of the guitar sound that our ears find important. These filters might emphasize the frequency bands corresponding to the unique tones produced by the guitar strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform (IDCT):\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "The Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform (IDCT) is used to convert frequency domain information back to the time domain. It is often applied in image compression, where the image is transformed into the frequency domain using the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) for compression and then reconstructed back using the IDCT. It is often used with FFTs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Think of a digital image of a sunset. The image can be compressed using the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). The IDCT would then be applied to reconstruct the compressed image. It's like taking a highly compressed version of the sunset image, applying the inverse transform, and getting back the detailed and colorful sunset picture we started with.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Spectrogram\n",
    "A spectrogram is like a musical timeline. It shows how loud different pitches are at every moment in a sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Think of a bird's song. A spectrogram would reveal when the bird sings high or low notes and how loud each part is throughout its melody. It's a way to visualize the musical story of the bird's song over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The spectrogram formula breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ S(f, t) = \\left|X(f, t)\\right|^2 \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "- $ S(f, t) $: Spectrogram, representing the magnitude of the spectral content at a specific frequency ($ f $) and time ($ t $).\n",
    "- $ X(f, t) $: Fourier transform of the signal $ x(t) $ at frequency $ f $ and time $ t $, a complex number with amplitude and phase information.\n",
    "- $ \\left|X(f, t)\\right| $: Magnitude (or modulus) of $ X(f, t) $, providing the amplitude of the signal at frequency $ f $ and time $ t $.\n",
    "- $ \\left|X(f, t)\\right|^2 $: Square of the magnitude, yielding the power spectral density, a measure of signal power or energy at a specific frequency and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula is used to compute spectrograms, which visualize how the frequency content of a signal changes over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Bandwidth:\n",
    "Definition: Bandwidth measures how spread out the frequencies in a signal are. A broader bandwidth indicates a wider range of frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its the maximum frequency (Fmax) minus (Fmin) the lowest frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "# Centroid:\n",
    "\\[ C = \\frac{\\sum_{i} f_i \\cdot A_i}{\\sum_{i} A_i} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "- $ C $: Centroid (average frequency).\n",
    "- $ f_i $: Frequency of the $ i $-th component.\n",
    "- $ A_i $: Amplitude (or magnitude) of the $ i $-th component.\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Centroid represents the center of mass of the frequency distribution. It indicates where most of the energy in the spectrum is concentrated.\n",
    "Its the average frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tonnetz\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "Tonnetz is like a musical map, visually representing how different pitches or chords relate harmonically. Points close together on the hexagonal lattice indicate a strong harmonic connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider the chords A minor and E minor. In Tonnetz, they would be visually close, reflecting their harmonic compatibility. On the other hand, A minor and F# major might be farther apart, indicating a less harmonically related pair. Tonnetz simplifies the analysis of harmonic relationships in music.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Spectral rolloff\n",
    "the spectral rolloff is simply the frequency that splits the frequency below a certain percentage of the total spectral energy, usually this is at 85%\n",
    " The formula is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ R = \\frac{\\sum_{f} S(f)}{\\sum_{f} S(f_{\\text{total}})} \\cdot 100 \\leq p \\]\n",

    "- $ R $: Spectral rolloff frequency.\n",
    "- $ S(f) $: Spectral energy at frequency $ f $.\n",
    "- $ S(f_{\\text{total}}) $: Total spectral energy.\n",
    "- $ p $: Percentage of total spectral energy (e.g., 85% or 95%).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Chroma Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "Chroma features provide insights into the pitch distribution in music, emphasizing tonal qualities. The chromagram has classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chroma features are computed using the chromagram, where each chroma value (C_i) is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ C_i = \\sum_{j} \\text{magnitude}(f_j) \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "- $ C_i $: Chroma value for the $ i $-th pitch class.\n",
    "- $ \\text{magnitude}(f_j) $: Magnitude of the $ j $-th frequency component in the spectrum.\n",
    "- The summation is done over all frequency components that correspond to the $ i $-th pitch class.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is repeated for each of the twelve pitch classes to obtain the complete chroma features.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Spectral Contrast\n",
    "\n",
    "Spectral Contrast is a feature in audio signal processing that measures the difference in amplitude between peaks and valleys in a frequency spectrum. It helps capture the perceptual contrast between the spectral peaks and background noise, providing information about the tonal quality of the sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no common formula for spectral contrast.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Spectral Flatness\n",
    "\n",
    "Spectral Flatness, also known as tonality or flatness, is a measure of how tonal or noisy a sound is. A perfectly tonal sound (e.g., a sine wave) has high flatness, while a noisy sound has low flatness.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no common formula for spectral flatness.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Zero-Crossing Rate:\n",
    "\n",
    "Zero-Crossing Rate (ZCR) measures how often an audio signal changes its sign, reflecting its noisiness or tonality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula: $ ZCR = \\frac{\\text{Number of zero-crossings}}{\\text{Total number of samples} - 1} $\n",
    "\n",
    "- The numerator is the count of times the signal changes sign (crosses zero).\n",
    "- The denominator is the total number of samples minus one to account for the fact that zero-crossing rate is defined as the rate per sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tempogram\n",
    "\n",
    "Tempogram shows the tempo or rhythmic characterisics of music. It provides a way to analyze the variations in tempo, beat, or rhythmic patterns within an audio signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculation of a tempogram involves computing the local autocorrelation of the audio signal at different time lags. The formula is somewhat complex and involves signal processing techniques, such as Fourier transforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "$[ T(\\tau) = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \\text{Spec}(\\omega_n) \\cdot \\text{Spec}^*(\\omega_n, \\tau) $]\n",

    "- $[( \\text{Spec}(\\omega_n) $): Short-time Fourier transform of the audio signal at frequency $( \\omega_n $]).\n",
